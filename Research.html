		<h2>Wireless Network Recovery from Natural Disaster</h2>
		<!-- <h4> ongoing research </h4> -->
		<p class="justifie">At the advent of the wireless network t
			echnology (for example 5G), it has been emerged as the most popular
			to provide communication service to areas. However, when natural
			disasters happen (like earthquake, typhoon, etc.), network
			infrastructure devices such as mesh routers (MRs) and base stations
			(BSs) can be easily destroyed. Therefore, it becomes of essential
			importance to efficiently build up the wireless network and rapidly
			provide services to people during or after disasters. In this study,
			we propose a movable and deployable resource unit (MDRU) based
			wireless network recovery architecture. In our proposal, a MDRU
			usually consists of processing servers, storage servers and Internet
			backhaul connectivity. It can be rapidly transported and configured
			in disaster areas so as to efficiently provide wireless Internet
			access, along with MRs deployed there. Specifically, we focus on
			planning and deploying dense WLAN networks such as determining the
			optimal density of APs.</p>

		<h2>RF-sensing in Pervasive Computing</h2>
		<!-- <h4> ongoing research </h4> -->
		<p class="justifie">RF signals are defined by their amplitude,
			phase, and frequency. During signal propagation from the transmitter
			to the receiver, the radio waves are affected by physical phenomena
			through, for example, damping, reflection, and scattering. Experts in
			industry and academia have recognized the RF signal and its harmonics
			as a potential source of process information. It is applied to
			various technologies, such as Wi-Fi, FM radio, and etc. In the first
			place, we used FM radio based RF sensing to infer individual’s
			attention by analysing signal fluctuations due to interruption by
			people in their walking speed and direction. In addition, we are
			accounting people indoors or outdoors from CSI fluctuation of
			beamforming by utilizing beamforming’s feature of steerable antennas,
			which is best suited for detecting CSI fluctuation in the path of
			main beam by scanning in clock. This work can be extended to other
			applications such as activity detection, seeing through walls, etc.
			We are also working on releasing the CSI tool by hacking the 802.11ac
			wireless network adaptor for the wider spread of beamforming in
			pervasive computing.</p>
